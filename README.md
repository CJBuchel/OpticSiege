# OpticSiege
Small game engine for low-end visual games. Using cross-platform build scripts generated by premake. And OpenGL for cross-platform rendering.


## Setup for building

1. Build setup

	- Clone the engine with all the submodules, if you're on windows you will need to have Visual Studio installed to be able to build the project. On Linux you will need to install the normal build tools for compiling C++ projects with makefiles. GCC/GNU. You may need to also install GL libraries using `sudo apt-get install libgl-dev`. On macOS the simillar applies for building using gmake.

	- This project uses premake to setup build for local operating system. To use premake first link the Premake/bin folder to you system path, or copy the folder to a different location for your own convenienve (unless you already have premake installed and linked)

	- Once binaries are linked, in cmd/terminal run `premake5 vs2019` in the root directory to build solution and project files.

	- For linux/mac run `./premake5 gmake` or `./premake5_mac gmake` instead.
